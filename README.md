*Given a single user's activity, can we predict what he is going to do next?*

Imagine that we have a user named bob in our app. Bob likes image 1 and dislikes image 2. We want to know the probability of bob hitting the like button when he sees image 3.

Our approach is to train a transformer model which takes a sequence of image embeddings and corresponding "activity tokens" as input and tries to predict the next "activity token". Activity tokens can be anything: `<like>, <dislike>, <zoom>, <bookmark> etc`

# Dataset

We pre-train on the [pick-a-pic v2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuvalkirstain/pickapic_v2).

**Data collection workflow**

1. A user writes a prompt.
2. The user is shown 2 images generated by the prompt
3. The user is asked to select the image he prefers. If he has no preference, then it's a tie.
4. The rejected image is replaced with a newly generated image and the process is repeated.

**Reformatting data for autoregressive modeling**
